# Click Counter (Up and Down) Project

This project demonstrates a simple **Click Counter** system using an **Arduino board**, two **push buttons**, and a **7-segment display**. The counter can be incremented and decremented based on button presses.

## 🛠️ Components Used:
- **Arduino Uno** board
- **2 Push buttons**
- **1 x 7-Segment Display**
- **Jumper wires**
- **Breadboard**
- **Resistors** (for the push buttons)

## ⚙️ How It Works:
- Two push buttons are used to control the counting:
  - One button **increments** the count.
  - The other button **decrements** the count.
- The count is displayed in **real-time** on a 7-segment display.
- The counter's value increases or decreases by 1 with each button press, and the display is updated immediately.

## 📝 Code Explanation:
1. **Button Inputs**: The two push buttons are connected to specific pins on the Arduino board.
2. **7-Segment Display**: The counter is shown on a 7-segment display. The code drives the display based on the count value.
3. **Debouncing**: The code handles button debouncing to avoid multiple counts from a single press.
4. **Simple Logic**: Each button press either increments or decrements the counter and updates the display accordingly.

## 🔧 Circuit Diagram:
Below is a basic description of the circuit:
- **7-Segment Display**: Each segment (A-G) of the display is connected to a separate pin on the Arduino board.
- **Push Buttons**: Connected to digital input pins on the Arduino, with pull-down resistors to ensure stable readings.

## 🚀 How to Use:
1. **Set up the hardware**: Connect the push buttons and 7-segment display to the Arduino following the provided circuit diagram.
2. **Upload the code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Press the buttons**: Press the increment button to increase the count and the decrement button to decrease the count.
4. **Observe the display**: The 7-segment display will show the updated count value.
